# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections requested an audit for the local congressional election. The audit read the election data to organize and separate information into a readable format. This created two sections, candidates and counties. The election audit read the votes per category, the percentage out of all the votes, and the winners of both categories.

## Summary
This script to be used for all upcoming elections. The code that is already set up can be easily modified for the use of all election data as it is designed to loop through and calculate the highest numbers or the most votes. It can be used as an easy summary of how an election went for safekeeping or even for analysis to be used in upcoming elections. The code is set up using a specific location, so it would be really simple to use it for any type of election.
